# Job Search Landing Page

This project is a React implementation of a job search landing page, inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge. The primary goal is to create a functional and visually appealing platform for users to search and filter job listings.

## Key Features

- **Filterable job listings**: Users can refine their search results by selecting relevant categories.
- **Responsive design**: The page layout adjusts to the user's device screen size for an optimal viewing experience.
- **Interactive elements**: Hover and focus states are implemented for all interactive components on the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML**: Pre-written content and structure provided in the starter code.
- **CSS**: Styles written using a pre-processor (Sass/Less/Stylus) to manage colors, fonts, and layout.
